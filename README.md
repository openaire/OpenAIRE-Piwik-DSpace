## Configure SQLite DB for missing requests
In case of Matomo connectivity issues an SQLite Database is used to store missing requests. 
- To create the DB:
	
```bash
[dspace.dir]/bin/dspace resend-to-matomo -create
```
- Any time during the day, or once a week, execute the following command to submit the missing requests to Matomo

```bash
[dspace.dir]/bin/dspace resend-to-matomo -retry
```
 
 -  After sending the missing requests, execute the following command to delete submitted requests from the DB

 ```bash
 [dspace.dir]/bin/dspace resend-to-matomo -delete
```
